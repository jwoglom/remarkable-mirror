# tarball: a packed tarball runs no lifecycle scripts, so this needs no bun, no
# devDependencies, no git and no typecheck. --ignore-scripts belts-and-braces.
#
# node 24, not the 22 that rmapi-js's `engines` allows: v12.0.0 calls
# Uint8Array#toHex and #toBase64 on its write paths, which only exist in bun and
# node 24+. On node 22 reads work and every upload dies with
# "toHex is not a function".
